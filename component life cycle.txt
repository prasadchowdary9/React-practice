React components have 4 life cycle methods in it during the period.
those are Mounting and Updating and Unmounting and Error Handling.

Mounting - it is called when an instance of a component being created and inserted into the dom.
Updating - When a component is re rendered as a result of changes in its props or state
Unmounting - When a component is being removed from the DOM
Error Handling - When there is an error during rendering in a life cycle method or in a constructor of child component.

For Each life cycles some Methods are there.
For Mounting Phase:
  four methods are there:
  1. Constructor-A special function that will called when a new component is created and it will initialize state and binding event hand
  2. static getDerivedStateFromProps- when the state of component depends on changes in props over the timeand set state
  3. render
  4. componentDidMount

For Updating phase:
  five methods are there:
  1. static getDerivedStateFromProps- this Method is called every time when the component is re rendered. and set the state
  2. shouldComponentUpdate- this dictates that the component should update or not. it will check existing state amd props with current  value and then return true or false. mainly used for performance optimization

  3. render-
  4. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate- called right before the changes from the virtual dom are to be  reflected into the DOM. and captures some information from the DOM. This method will retur either null or a value. The returned value will be passed to the third parameter into the next method.
  5. componentDidUpdate- called after the render is finished  in the re render cycles. it will call once
For Unmounting  phase:
  one method is there:
1.willComponentUnMount- this method is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted or destroyeds. ex - cancelling any network connections and removing even handlers etc

For Error Handling Phase:
 two methods are there:
 1. static getDerivedStateFromError
 2. componentDidCatch

A class component that can implement either both or any one method to becomes error boundary
static getDerivedStateFromError method id used to get fallback UI
componentDidCAtch method is used to log th error information



Difference between Regular Component and Pure Component 



A regular component does not implement the should component update method by default it returns the true
But The Pure component method on other hand implements should componentupdatemethod with a shllow props and state comparsion.

For class components pure components are there but for the same cause ReactMemo comes into picture for Functional compoenents.***


HIGHER ORDER COMPONENT:

It is a pattern where a function takes a component as an argument and returns a new component

const newComponent = higherOrderComponent(originalComponent)
